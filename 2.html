including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages
 to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate. <br>css
 file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content
 as well as enabling the. <br>css file to be cached to improve the page load
 speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

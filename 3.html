    is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
  programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known
  as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also
  use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
  prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
  object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming)
  styles. Read more about JavaScript.
